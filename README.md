# Desired

Given the current state of an object and the desired state of an object, desired aims to
be more clear that an object matches its desired state.

The problem seen with other projects includes comparing for equality, rather than simply 
comparing that certain items that we care about (e.g. the fields of a YAML definition) 
match a desired state, while ignoring others that are not set.
